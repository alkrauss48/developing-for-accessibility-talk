So what are we
going to talk about?

Developing for Accessibility

What is Accessibility?

a11y

Accessibility = caring about people

All people

That includes users with disabilities

And also users with no disabilities at all

Developing an accessible site
will make your site better

And it's probably required

* Section 508
* ADA

Types of Disabilities

* Visual
* Motor
* Auditory
* Cognitive

Visual Concerns

* Color-blindness
* Contrast
* Low-or-no Vision

Motor Concerns

* Chronic pain
* low-motor function

So how do you develop
for accessibility?

Can I use one of
those website plugins?

The answer is:

No

1) They are afterthoughts
2) They get you < 50% there
3) You can still get sued

So how do you develop
for accessibility?

1) Write semantic HTML
2) Use ARIA only as needed

ARIA = Accessible Rich
Internet Applications

"No ARIA is better
than bad ARIA."

DEMO

Auditory Concerns

* Subtitles
* Volume controls
* Ideally default to a "muted" state

My advice:
Use YouTube or Vimeo

Cognitive Concerns

* Good content
* Good UX
* Consider "Panic" mode

Think websites like:
* Hospitals
* Schools
* Local News / Weather

Bonus Disability

Drum Roll...

"Data" Disability

Not all users have a ton of data,
let alone fast connections

So what can you do?

0. Optimize your images
1. Minify & Tree-shake your CSS and JS
2. Don't overdo it on custom fonts
3. Use caching
