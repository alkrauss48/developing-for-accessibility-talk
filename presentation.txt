Developing for
Accessibility

This talk has one focus:

For you to come out
with actionable things
that you can do today
for your projects

You are not expected to be
an accessibility expert

Give yourself the grace to
learn this stuff, just like
when you first learned to code

So what are we

Developing for Accessibility

What is Accessibility?

a11y

Accessibility = caring about people

All people

That includes users with disabilities

And also users with no disabilities at all

The Pitch

Building an accessible web site
makes your website better overall

* Better design architecture
* Better code architecture
* More quality content
* Better SEO
* More usage and popularity

And all of that usually means more $$$

Developing an accessibile site
may also be required

* Section 508
* ADA

Types of Disabilities

* Visual
* Motor
* Auditory
* Cognitive

Visual Concerns

* Color-blindness
* Contrast
* Low-or-no Vision

Low-or-no Vision

People will often use screen readers

Windows - JAWS
MacOS - VoiceOver (built-in)

Accessibility tree

Tips for developing for visual impairments:

* Use semantic HTML
* Don't use px for text
* Use headings appropriately
* Image alt tags
* Use links & buttons correctly
* ARIA roles and attributes - as needed

ARIA = Accessible Rich
Internet Applications

The best ARIA
is no ARIA

Motor Concerns

Users may struggle to use
their mouse and/or keyboard

* Skip menus
* Good Tab flow
* Focus indicators
* "Submit" actions (space/enter)
* "Cancel" actions (esc)

DEMO

Auditory Concerns

For primary audio media:

* Subtitles
* Volume controls
* Ideally default to a "muted" state

My advice:

Use YouTube or Vimeo

For supplemental audio:

* Visual cues
* Nothing absurd (i.e. loud, lengthy, confusing)

Cognitive Concerns

* Good content
* Good UX
* "Panic" mode

Think websites like:
* Hospitals
* Schools
* Local News / Weather

Bonus Disability

Drum Roll...

"Data" Disability

Not all users have a ton of data,
let alone fast connections

So what can you do?

0. Optimize your images
1. Minify & Tree-shake your CSS and JS
2. Don't overdo it on custom fonts
3. Use caching
